In 1999 Allen B. Downey wrote <i>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</i>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>An introductory computer science textbook</li>
  <li>Using Java</li>
  <li>Released under GPL license</li>
</ul>

Prof. Downey's stated design goals for the book:</h2>
<ul style="margin-left: 2vw;">
  <li>Keep it short. Better for students to read 10 pages than not read 50.</li>

  <li>Be careful with vocabulary. Minimize jargon and define each term at first 
      use.</li>

  <li>Build gradually. To avoid trap doors, take most difficult topics and
      split them into series of small steps.</li>

  <li>Focus on programming, not the programming language. Include minimum
      useful subset of Java and leave the rest out.</li>
</ul>

Meanwhile, down in Arlington, Virginia, I was...</h2>
<ul style="margin-left: 2vw;">
  <li>teaching high school CS for Arlington Public Schools.</li>
  <li>a free software activist since discovering the GPL in 1993.</li>
  <li>teaching in a GNU/Linux lab with control over my software
      environment.</li>
  <li>desperately looking for a new programming language for our intro
      course.</li>
</ul>

<section>
<h2 style="text-align: left; margin-top: 10vw;">
Why was I looking for a new programming language?</h2>
<ul style="margin-left: 2vw; font-size: 3vw;">
  <li>AP Comp Sci exam switching from Pascal to C++ in 1999.</li>
  <li>Pascal was a <i>good</i> choice for a first programming language.</li>
  <li>C++ is a <i>bad</i> choice for a first programming language.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="font-size: 4.8vw; margin-top: 1vw;">Why Python?</h3>

surprising as the British comedy group it was named after, and in its own niche
the coding language has become just as famous and influential.</p>

Programmers love Python because...</h2>
<ul style="margin-left: 5vw; margin-top: 0;">
  <li>it is easy to write, and easy to read (it <i>fits your brain</i>).</li>
  <li>it has libraries available for almost any programming task you can
      think of.</li>
  <li>it helps make programming fun!</li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin-left: 2vw; font-size: 3vw;">
  <li>Michael McLay told me I should at a Linux install fest in 1995.</li>
  <li>free software community folks on the web said I should in 1999.</li>
  <li>student Matt Ahrens tested it out for me as a senior project and
      told me he accomplished more in 3 months with Python than he could have
      with C++ in 2 years.</li>
  <li>I was amazed at how well it "fit my brain" - programs often ran the
      first time without errors, and the language seemed to consitently
      work the way I thought it did.</li>

Decision to use Python made, what do I do now?</h2>
<ul style="margin-left: 7vw; margin-top: 0vw;">
  <li>The few existing Python books were about the language,
      not programming.</li>
  <li>I didn't feel able to write my own book.</li>
  <li>That's when Richard Stallman emailed me about Allen Downey's <i>How to
      Think Like a Computer Scientist</i>.</li> <li>While I couldn't write my
      own book, thanks to the GPL, I <i>could</i> turn his wonderful Java book
      into a Python book ... <i>So I did.</i></li>
  <li>And thus I became (until someone comes forward to contradict me) the
      first high school programming teacher to use Python in their
      classroom.</li>

An Open Educational Resources Fairy Tale</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 3vw; font-size: 2.6vw;">
By making HTTLCS OER before that was even a thing, Allen Downey changed lots of
lives for the better, including his own.</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 2vw; font-size: 1.8vw;">
  <li>This pioneering example of
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources">OER</a>,
  launched three years before the term <i>open educational resources</i> was
  coined at UNESCO's 2002 Forum on Open Courseware (Wikipedia 2022), led to
  numerous remixes, both into other programming languages and other natural
  languages, and continues to generate remixes twenty-four years later.
  </li>
  <li>The majority of the remixes use Python as the programming language, and
  indeed the use of the book grew along with the increasing popularity of
  Python as the programming language of choice for teaching introductory
  programming, allowing <i>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning
  with Python</i> to play an active part in the growth of Python in CS
  education.
  </li>
  <li>Dr. Downey has published over a dozen books, including <i>Think
  Python</i>, the current update of HTTLCS, <i>Think Stats</i>,
  <i>Think Bayes</i>, <i>Think Complexity</i>, <i>Elements of Data Science</i>
  and <i>Think DSP</i>, each of which use Python as a tool for teaching
  topics in computer science, information science and mathematics, and each of
  which are available as OER.</li>

A Special Shout Out to Dr. Chuck!</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 2vw; margin-left: 24vw; font-size: 3vw;

Dr. Charles Severance's video series make accessable, high quality resources
for beginners learning Python, Django, and other web technologies available
<i>for Everybody</i>.</p>

Closing Thoughts: Before I retire ...</h2>
<ul style="margin-left: 5vw; margin-top: 0; font-size: 2.2vw;">
<li>I hope to develop integrated, completely OER resources for the full
Associate Degree in Computer Science program offered through Northern Virginia
Community College:
  <ul style="margin-left: 10vw; margin-top: 1vw;">
    <li><a href="https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/CSC221-IntroductiontoProblemSolvingandProgramming">Introduction to Problem Solving and Programming</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/CSC222-ObjectOrientedProgramming">Object-Oriented Programming</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/CSC208-IntroductiontoDiscreteStructures">Introduction to Discrete Structures</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/CSC215-ComputerSystems">Computer Systems</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/CSC223-DataStructuresandAnalysisofAlgorithms">Data Structures and Analysis of Algorithms</a></li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>I'd like to use web application development as a project focus and
do combined projects with students in our web development course to make this
a "for everybody" program.</li>
<li>Thanks to Allen Downey and Charles Severance, I already have much of
what I need.</li>
<li>Ironically, I am returning to C++, the language from which I fled back in
1999, for two of the courses. I'm working on an updated remix of
<a href="http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/">How to Think Like a
Computer Scientist: Learning with C++</a> in time for next Fall.</li>
</ul>
